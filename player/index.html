  <h1 class="title">Hi There!</h1>
  <p class>
    Tada! 🎉 This is where the music comes from. Due to a restriction in YouTube's policy,
    we can't separate the audio from the video and the player must be visible at all times.
  </p>
  <div class="player-wrapper">
    <div id="ytplayer"></div>
  </div>
  <p>To save you some bandwidth, we select lowest possible video quality, Don't worry, this doesn't affect the audio in any way. Enjoy!</p>
